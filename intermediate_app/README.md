# intermediate_app: Quiz App üìù

New knowledges about Flutter

## Objectives
    - Reuse past knowledge with Flutter & Dart
    - Render content conditionally (Navigation)

# LogBook

### Init

* We started with an empty main.dart file
    * Write main() <function> (entrypoint)
    * Then call runApp() inside main() to call a root UI Widget
        * runApp() its a function of library flutter/material.dart
    * Tipically we pass to runApp(MaterialApp) the Widget <MaterialApp>, Widget for "Configuration"
        * MaterialApp its a Widget of library flutter/material.dart
    
    * <In this case> we pass to MaterialApp an argument called `home`, home its like the first Widget "parent" of children Widgets
        * We pass the value of Scaffold, Basic Layout Widget 

    * Inside <Scaffold> Widget we pass body argument, body its my first Widget that appears in my mobile screen and is used to organize more Widgets  

* We create new dart file (start_screen.dart)
    * Inside write class StartScreen and this class its extends with StatelessWidget 
        (because in this widget we dont need a state (data) that changes dynamically)

    * Inside class write build() method with @override decorator

    * And write simplificated constructor method:
        const StartScreen({super.key});
    
### StartScreen

#### `<main.dart>`
* Wrap StartScreen in Container Widget (VScode Refactor üí°)

* Use decoration argument of Container and add BoxDecoration Widget for add a gradient background to StartScreen Widget

#### `<start_screen.dart>`
* Wrap <Text> Widget with a <Center> Widget, <Center> Widget will try to get as much space as it can for full the entire screen

* Change <Text> Widget to <Column> Widget for organize child Widget's vertically
    * Use children argument for next Widgets...

#### `<pubspec.yaml>`
* Set up assets for Flutter project
    `assets:`

#### `<start_screen.dart>`

* Add Icon to OutlineedButton Widget "Start"
* Use the OutlinedButton constructor .icon()
    - change argument `child` to `label`
    - use argument `icon` with Icon Widget of Flutter
        * Flutter gives the Icons class with some predefined icons

* Work with opacity on Images for UI layout
* Add color argumento to Image Widget 
    * The best way for work with opacity is if you have color argument in Widget its possible to use a Color with opacity

### Quiz Widget

#### `<quiz.dart>`

* Create class <Quiz> extends StatefulWidget
* Create private class <_QuizState> extends State<Quiz> 
    * Quiz & _QuizState are connected with the brackets of State<>

* Inside <_QuizState> override build() method and return the MaterialApp Widget of main.dart file
* Inside <Quiz> override createState() method and connect to <_QuizState>
* Add basic constructor to <Quiz>

### QuestionsScreen Widget

#### `<questions_screen.dart>`

* Create a basic StatefulWidget called QuestionsScreen...

### Render Conditionally (Simple Navigation)

#### `<quiz.dart>`

* Create a variable type Widget `activeScreen`, set the value of StartScreen() Widget
* Create startQuizHandler() method, and inside use setState() method to change `activeScreen` value to QuestionScreen()

### Lifting up state for navigation

With the separation of StartScreen and QuestionsScreen adding a "shared parent Widget" called Quiz, Quiz it's a Widget responsable of state and state manipulation (StatefulWidget) used to render MaterialApp and a child called "activeScreen" this implementation it's a way to use as simple navigation between screens

#### `<quiz.dart>`

* Pass the function `switchScreen()` as new argument to StartScreen inside variable `activeScreen` 

#### `<start_screen.dart>`

* Add new argument in constructor, the argument it's a `void Function()` argument 
    - `void` because the fun not return nothing
    - `Function` it's a type of Dart
    - `()` because `startQuizHandler()` not receive any argument
* Optimize the new argument with a final variable
```
const StartScreen(this.startQuizHandler, {super.key});
final void Function() startQuizHandler;
```

* Use this new final variable in argument onPressed of OutlinedButton Widget 

#### `<quiz.dart>`

* Add `initState()` method because this implementation `Widget activeScreen = const StartScreen(switchScreen);` needs a correction
* initState(). Can be used for general initialization work
* Define the variable `activeScreen` -> `Widger? activeScreen;` 
    - ? . tells Dart that variable may contain a Widger OR null

‚ùó‚ùó‚ùó
#### Flutter's (Stateful) Widget Lifecycle

* The widget has a built-in lifecycle, represent with methods that automatically executed by Flutter:
    - initState(). Executed when Stateful Widget object is initialized 
    - build(). Executed when Widget is built for the first time AND after `setState()` was called
    - dispose(). Executed right before the Widget will be deleted

#### `<quiz.dart>` Ternary expression as alternative to Switch Screens without initState()

* Change `activeScreen` to var that retain a `string`
* Comment `initState()` method
* Update `switchScreen` function with new value to `activeScreen = 'questions-screen'`
* Use conditional render in argument `child` in `Container` Widget
```
child: activeScreen == 'start-screen'
    ? StartScreen(switchScreen)
    : const QuestionsScreen(),
``` 
 
#### `<quiz.dart>` Alternative to improve ternary expression with build() if

* Add a new variable inside build() method
```
Widget screenWidget = StartScreen(switchScreen);

if (activeScreen == 'questions-screen') {
    screenWidget = const QuestionsScreen();
}
```

### QuestionsScreen

* We need a new data structue that help us to manage Question and Answers (blueprints)
* Create new folder üìÇ called `models` inside `üìÇ lib`
* Create new file `models/quiz_question.dart`
* Create new folder üìÇ called `data` inside `üìÇ lib`
* Create new file `data/quiz_question.dart`
* Create new file `data/question.dart`


#### `<quiz_question.dart>`

* Use this file for manage questions and answers as a data structure


#### `<data.dart>`

* Use this file for questions memory data

#### `<questions_screen.dart>`

* Implement correct UI layout to QuestionsScreen

* Alternative to wrap <Column> with <Center>:
    - Wrap <Column> with <SizedBox>
    - Add widht argument to <SizedBox>:
        - `width: double.infinity` - That simply means 'use as much width as you can' 

--

* Create new file `answer_button.dart`, it's a new component for the AnswerButton Widget for reuse in QuestionsScreen

#### `<answer_button.dart>`

* Create new StatelessWidget

* Add argument of answerText -> Text of the button
* Add argument of onTap -> Handler action when the button taps
* Finish layout of AnswerButton with the argument `style`
    * New styles concepts:
        - `shape: RoundedRectangleBorder(borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(35)),`
        - `padding: const EdgeInsets.symmetric(vertical: 10, horizontal: 40),`

#### `<questions_screen.dart>` Adding questions and answers from `./data/questions.dart`

* Import file `./data/questions.dart`
* Create new variable inside build()
    - `final currentQuestion = questions[0];`
* Implement new variable in render layout
* For answers we need the built-in functions of Lists `.map()` render for less code and optimization 
    - For default `.map()` method returns a list and the `children` argument of <Column> needs a List of Widgets
    - Add `...` before `.map()`, that allow to return the item of list out separated with a comma
    ```
    ...currentQuestion.answers.map((item) {
        return AnswerButton(
            answerText: item,
            onTap: () {},
        );
    }),
    ```
* Add `crossAxisAlignment` argument to <Column>
    - `crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.stretch,`
* Wrap <Column> with a <Container> and use argument `margin`
    - `margin: const EdgeInsets.all(45),`

#### `<quiz_question.dart>` Add functionality to randomize answers

* Create new method inside structure called `getShuffledAnswers`

#### `<questions_screen.dart>` Implement the new getShuffledAnswers() method of structure

* in .map() use the new method `getShuffledAnswers`

#### `<questions_screen.dart>` Implement the logic to move to next question when answered succeed

* add new function `answerQuestion()`
* Use setState inside the function to dinamically change question render

#### Adding a third-party package (Google Fonts)

- Command for installation of a thid-party package 
    `flutter pub add google_fonts`
- Use this new third-party package in some text of application
```
Text(
    'Flutter Quiz!',
    style: GoogleFonts.jetBrainsMono(
        color: Colors.white,
        fontSize: 30
    )
),
```

#### Passing values across multiple Widgets (Pass the user answer) 

#### `<quiz.dart>`

* Create new variable called `selectedAnswers`
    - `final List<String> selectedAnswers = [];`
* Implement new method `chooseAnswer()`
* Pass new method as an argument to QuestionsScreen

#### `<questions_screen.dart>`
* Implement that QuestionsScreen accepts a new argument `onSelectAnswer`
    - `final void Function(String answer) onSelectAnswer; `

* Use the widget built-in property to access the new argument `onSelectAnswer`
* Update `answerQuestion()` with the new implementation

#### Work in the Results Screen <results_screen.dart>

* Construct a StatelessWidget with principal layout (UI)
* Add this new results screen on the switchScreen (navigation)

* Separate layout of `<questions_summary.dart>` in more components
