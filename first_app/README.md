🔵 Project (Folders & Files)

* `📂 /lib`. Contains Dart code (.dart)
* `📂📂📂 /android /macos /linux /windows /web /ios`. Contains platform specific files, important on deployment phase
* `📂 /build`. Contains temporary and output files generated by Flutter
* `📂 /test`. Test Code
* `📄 .metadata`. Managed automatically by Flutter
* `📄 analysis_options.yaml`. Settings for lint
* `📄 *.iml`. Managed automatically by Flutter (metadata for building flutter app)
* `📄 pubspec.taml`. Allows configurations and manage dependencies, you can add third party packages Flutter/Dart

🔵 Flutter Widgets I

MaterialApp. Core widget, used as starting point for build a Flutter App

🔵 Dart. Kinds of Parameters

🟠 Positional: The position of an argument determines which parameter receives the value
```
void add(a, b) { // a & b are positional parameters
  print(a + b);
}
 
add(5, 10); // a = 5, because it's the first argument; b = 10
```

🟠 Named: The name of an argument determines which parameter receives the value
```
void add({a, b}) { // a & b are named parameters (because of the curly braces)
  print(a + b); 
}  
 
add(b: 5, a: 10); // 5 is used as a value for b, because it's assigned to that name; a = 10
```

--
<h3>❗ Positional parameters are required and must not be omitted - on the other hand, named arguments are optional and can be omitted. ❗</h3>
--

🟢 Positional arguments can be made optional by wrapping them with square brackets ([]):
```
void add(a, [b]) { // b is optional
  print(a + b);
}
```
🟢 Optional parameter with default value
 ```
void add(a, [b = 5]) { // b is optional, 5 will be used as a default value
  print(a + b);
}
 ```

🟢 Default values in named parameters
```
void add({a, b = 5}) { // b has a default value of 5
  print(a + b); 
}  
```

🟢 Required parameters with keyword `required`
```
void add({required a, required b}) { // a & b are no longer optional
  print(a + b); 
}  
```

🔵 Flutter Widgets II

MainApp. Entrypoint of Tree-Widgets (Root Widget)
Scaffold. Screen Layout Widget (You can add styling)
Text. Display Text on Screen

🟡 VSCode Shortcuts

Refactor. Ctrl + shift + R
Format Document. Alt + shift + F
  * To use format you need to indicate to IDE the end of widget with a comma (,)

--

<h3>❗Recommended to always add these commas after closing parenthesis❗</h3>

🔵 Dart Types

* All values are of certain Types
* More than one Type is possible & Common

Examples:
- 'Hi' -> String -> Object
- MaterialApp -> MaterialApp -> Widget -> Object

Object. The base value on Dart

🔵 Flutter Widgets III

Container. Useful Widget for configuring styling and layout settings
  * Container not support `const` parent widget 

🔵 Separate Widgets (Classes)

For separating big widgets, Dart use classes 

🔵 Dart Class

* Class it's the blueprint of a Object, because Dart is an objetc-oriented language
* Objects are Data Structures
  * Data (properties)
  * Functions (methods)

* Objects help with organizing data & separating logic

<h3>❗Objects are built bases on classes❗</h3>

🔵 Separate Widgets (Files with classes)

* You need to use `snake_case` style when you separate your widget class into file
    Example: `gradient_container.dart`

🔵 `this` keyword in Dart

* `this` is a keyword used inside of classes, can refer the class itself or refer to the object

🔵 Column & Row Flutter Widgets

* Column. Allow to render multiple widgets, multiple children above each other (Vertically)
* Row. Allow render multiple widgets, but next to each other (Horizontally)

🔵 Flutter Buttons

* ElevatedButton. Button with background color and a slight shadow
* OutlinedButton. Button without background color but a border
* TextButton. Button with simple pressable text

🔵 Anonymous Function Dart

* Sintaxis
`() {}`
```() {
    ...
}
```
TextButton(onPressed: >> () {} <<, child: const Text("Roll Dice"))

🔵 Flutter more Widgets
SizedBox. Create a box of a certain size, you can add a child widget inside box
    * SizedBox has fixed width and height 
EdgeInsets. Allow to set a padding


🔵 Flutter StatelessWidget & StatefulWidget

StatelessWidget
* Normally you use this Widget when you dont need an `state` (data)
* Don't manage any internal data
* Only update the screen if parent widgets are updated ("re-rendered")

〰️*Special Note*: Should be your default: Use as often as possible

StatefulWidget
* Allow to manage `state` (data) inside of them...
    - State is data that may change over time and that should impact the rendered UI

* Do manage internal data ("state")
* When state changes, the Widget is re-rendered & UI is updated

〰️*Special Note*: Use whenever you have changing data that should cause UI updates

🔵 More about StatefulWidget

* Needs a constructor called `createState()` that returns `State<>` generic object `<>`
* Always work with two classes 

    Example
    1. class <ClassName> extends StatefulWidget { ... }
    2. class _<ClassName>State extends State<ClassName> { ... }
        * This private class needs the build constructor `build()`

* `setState()` function its necessary when you need to reflect changes on UI
